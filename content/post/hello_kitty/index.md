# How did Hello Kitty start?

Hello Kitty is one of the most popular and recognizable characters in the world. The cute kitty was created by the Japanese company Sanrio in 1974 and depicted as a white cat with a red bow and no visible mouth. Hello Kitty was originally designed by Yuko Shimizu and was intended to be a simple and cute character that could be marketed to young girls, but, even adults fell in love with Hello Kitty as well.

Shintaro Tsuji, the founder of Sanrio, started his career by selling sandals decorated with flower paintings. When he realized that the sandals with paintings of cute cartoon characters sold faster, he began to hire cartoonists to design characters for him. Hello Kitty was first designed by Yuko Shimizu. While she originally coined the name kitty for the character, Tsuji decided to name the cat “Hello Kitty” to promote social communication.
